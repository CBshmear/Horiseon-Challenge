# Horiseon-Challenge

## Description

A repository for refactoring Horiseon's social solutions webpage.
Semantic HTML elements are important for source code readability and comprehension. 
Accesibilty guidelines are important for browser function and for users accessing the webpage with various disabilities.
The webpage did not conform to accesibility criteria and lacked semantic HTML elements.
The code now reflects these principles and is much easier to comprehend as a developer. 

## Issues Faced

The code lacked any real structure and was basically div soup. No sections were laid out and the code lacked a main body. One of the links in the nav bar was not functioning. None of the images had alt tags.
